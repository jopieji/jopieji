## Hi Everyone!
### I'm **Jake Opie**. 


- 👋 I'm a fourth year student at DePaul University studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Software Development.
- 👀 I’m interested in sports, cooking, finance, sustainability, and music.
- 🛠️ Currently, I'm building a reminder application using .NET and React that will push reminder notifications to my cell phone and email daily. I was working on a finance tracking application built on top of Teller, but ran into some blocks and got busy with schoolwork.
Last summer, I worked at Climate LLC for a second consecutive year working on the Data Experience team. I've been focused on production support, configuring observability software, leading a cost-tracking initiative, and working on our microservices architecture using a multitude of software tools, languages, and techniques.
  My fall quarter was largely spent working on my [capstone project](https://github.com/Green-Goblins-CSC394/greenGroupEcommerce) for my Computer Science degree program.
  My winter quarter was spent helping my mom launch her business and learning about distributed systems and web assembly in my coursework.
- 💼 I just accepted an offer from Climate to work as an Engineer starting in 2024! I'm so excited to return to such an innovative company and continue working in Chicago with my insightful and intelligent colleagues
- :closed_book: I am entering my last quarter at DePaul University, and I'm stepping out of my comfort zone with courswork in web applications, real time networking (on hardware), and optimized C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Rust projects or anything interesting the open source space!
