## Hi Everyone!
### My name is **Jake Opie**. 


- 👋 I'm a third year student at DePaul University studying with an emphasis in Software Development.
- 👀 I’m interested in sports, cooking, financesustainability, and music.
- 🛠️ I'm recently finished a basic version of a Java-based Git Repository Code Analysis tool. I started a new internship at CCC Intelligent Solutions in January, and I'm working on the Workflow team on security optimizations, new security protocols, and API development and enhancements for my team's main search algorithm.
