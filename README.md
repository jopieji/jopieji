## Hi Everyone!
### I'm **Jake Opie**. 


- 👋 I'm a software engineer and recent graduate from DePaul University.
- 👀 I’m interested in sports, cooking, finance, sustainability, and music.
- 💼 I currently work at Climate / Bayer Crop Science on an event-driven microservices architecture spearheading innovative and efficient digital farming practices.
- 🛠️ Currently, I'm building a reminder application using C# and React that will push reminder notifications to my cell phone and email daily. I'm also looking to complete a personal finance tracking application I started before my last (chaotic) quarter of school that uses Teller. 
  My fall quarter was largely spent working on my [capstone project](https://github.com/Green-Goblins-CSC394/greenGroupEcommerce) for my Computer Science degree program.
  My winter quarter was spent helping my mom launch her business and learning about distributed systems and web assembly in my coursework.
  My spring quarter was spent writing optimized C++, interfacing with hardware and studying IoT deployments, and creating a web application using C#, React, and AWS.
- :closed_book: I just graduated Summa Cum Laude from DePaul Univeristy with a BS in Computer Science.
