## Hi Everyone!
### My name is **Jake Opie**. 


- 👋 I'm a third year student at DePaul University studying with an emphasis in Software Development.
- 👀 I’m interested in sports, cooking, finance, sustainability, and music.
- 🛠️ I'm recently finished a basic version of a Java-based Git Repository Code Analysis tool. I just wrapped up an internship at CCC Intelligent Solutions in May. I worked on the Workflow team on security optimizations, new security protocols, API development, and enhancements for my team's main search algorithm.
  Now, I'm starting up again at Climate LLC working on the Data Experience team. I've been focused on production support, tackling a variety of problems using a multitude of software tools, languages, and techniques.
- :closed_book: I'm excited for my Fall coursework at DePaul in compiler design and independent software study.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on financial related projects and projects finding creative solutions regarding sustainability.
